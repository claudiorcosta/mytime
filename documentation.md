Assignment 2

Contemporary Web Applications (COM623)






Tutor: Joe Appleton 								DATE 06th January 2020
# Introduction
The following assessment is a follow up of the first assessment developed for the module of Contemporary Web Applications, where the goal was to try and find what was a problem that students usually had while they were at university and find a solution for that specific problem. After that assignment was finished it was concluded that one of the problems that students have is related with mental health but also with managing their time, where both can be related since a poor mental health can lead to a student not being able to manage their time in the best way possible to them in order to achieve academic success. The possible solution found to try and solve this problem was by creating an application that allows a user to manage the tasks that are in need of being completed and another function that allows users to see five steps to achieve a better state related with their mental health, by seeing the details related with each task.
# Methodology
## Design Thinking
The overarching methodology used in the previous assignment, which helped to define the problem mentioned above and find the solution to that problem was with the help of Design Thinking, where it was analysed the first three steps present in this methodology, leaving the last two steps for this stage of the development stage, which are prototyping and testing. These two stages will allow to evaluate the current prototype to see if there are any changes that need to be done in order to improve it without the need of making too many changes that would delay the development of the project itself.
## Agile
As it was said above, with the help of Design thinking it was possible to come up with a solution for a problem that was found during the research, but for the stage of development the methodology used was with the help of agile, where, according to Masood and Farooq (2017), agile shows some advantages that are considered to be important when used, where in those are included a bigger satisfaction when it comes to the customers, which is always one of the goals when developing a product that it is being created for someone and also it helps the development of those projects faster,  hence why it was used in this project. Even though this project is considered to be a small-scale project, the goal is to satisfy not only the developer but also the public to whom this project is being targeted and to be completed within the deadline that it was given.  One of the other steps and one that usually it is important when choosing the methodology to be used when developing a software is that Agile eliminates the need of reworking the entire project when there are changes that were not seen at the beginning of the planning of the project by allowing to incorporate those in all the steps.
Which was the case in this project, where in order to make it more simple to be used, it was removed pages, where in the beginning it was thought that all of them were going to be necessary but as the project was being developed it was being noticed that it was going to be possible to implement certain functions in one page only, being one of the examples the way that users were going to see the details about the tasks that they desired to see, where in the first place the system was designed to redirect the user to another page to see those details, but after careful consideration it was created a button that when clicked it is going to toggle the details of the task that the user wants to see but on the same page and this approach was taken after considering that nowadays simplicity is considered to be one of the most important factors present in the design of a system (Lee et al. 2015), and this is given the reason that when a system is created based one simplicity, usually is a system that it is well organized and prioritizes the main tasks from a specific system, where in this case it was the way the users could manage their tasks and find steps to achieve a healthy mental health. 
# Methods
In order to see if this project could solve the specific problem that it was trying to be solved, it was asked to five participants to use the application and give the final comments towards the application by asking a set of questions (Appendix 2), that each one of those were regarding a specific element that it was thought it was important in being analysed, which were the following:
•	Terminology: allowed to see if the users found it easy to understand what is the functionality of each element present in the website;
•	Layout/Design: If all the elements are easy to find at first sight when a user wants to complete a specific task;
•	Goal of the application: last but not least, this can be considered the most important part being analysed, since it will show if the solution showed will help solved the problem that it was stated above.
# Conclusion
After analysing all the questions that were answered by the participants it is possible to conclude that when it comes to the terminology used in each element, the participants said that it was easy to understand what each of those elements was going to do, and it is important to notice that all the participants have a different level when it comes to the English language. Regarding the goal of the application it was said that they did not know how mental health and time management can be related between them, and after giving a brief explanation on how mental health can affect different aspects of their life it was understood but there was still some doubts, finally the comments about the layout of the application were that it should present a different design and one of the comments made by one of the participants was regarding the login/register page, to why do not just have the option to do it with the social media instead of having to go through the process of typing the necessary information to complete that process as it would save the user more time in having access to the application. This comment caused some curiosity which led to do some research on this specific topic so that it was possible to see if it would be worth it to remove the login and register input boxes and leave the social logins. And it was found that in a case study that it was made by google that applications that did not use social login methods and started to use them presented with a significant growth on the number of users using that specific application. After careful consideration and reading through that case study it was decided to remove the input boxes from the login a register page, in order to see a bigger number of users using the application.
On a personal level, it is possible to conclude that there is a good satisfaction level towards the final product, even though there is still some doubt if an application like this one will help seek a healthier mental health, it is known that this topic takes time to improve and an application like the one that it was developed might help improve it and help the person that it is using the application to manage their time and tasks, but when it comes to the design of the same it is known that it should present a better design theme, which would led to a higher level regarding the satisfaction towards the final product.
# Appendices
## Appendix 1 – User Story
### User 1
#### Goal	Manage tasks that need to be completed	Find ways to improve mental health
#### Result	Allows to manage all the time and what needs to be done first	
### User 2
#### Goal	Find ways to improve mental health
#### Result	Allows to manage all the time and what needs to be done first	
	Allows to not only improve mental health but also other aspects of life in a personal aspect
## Appendix 2 – Usability testing Questions
1.	Do you believe that this application could help a student achieve a healthy mental health?
2.	Are the elements easy to be find and is it easy to understand what is the functionality of each method?
3.	When it comes to the layout/design of the page is there anything that you would change about it?
